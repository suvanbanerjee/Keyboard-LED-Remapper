# Keyboard LED Remapper


Apart form the CAPS LOCK the NUM LOCK and the SCROLL LOCK on your keyboard are not used for anything meaninfull. This project aims to change that by allowing you to use these LED's as indicators for various system events. Like Disk Activity, Network Activity, CPU Usage, etc.

## Description

This project is my first github project. It used to be a simple shell script that I used to run on my computer to use the Scroll Lock LED as the Disk Activity LED. But now after 2 years of learning programming, I have decided to make it better now this is TUI installer that can applay the earlier mentioned functionality to your computer with a bonus of choosing any light on your keyboard and some other cool functions to choose from. It works on both Wayland and X11.

## Legacy Version
The original shell script is still available in the legacy branch. you can find it [here](https://github.com/suvanbanerjee/keyboard-led-remapper/tree/legacy)
